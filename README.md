# Wikipedia-IPA-Extension

**Wikipedia-IPA-Extension** is the frontend for a small project I started to read the IPA on Wikipedia articles out loud.
I remember trying the existing extension out there, but it had an issue, so I recreated it.


# Installation

1. Download the project and extract it
2. Go to chrome://extensions
3. Tick the 'developer mode' box on the top right
4. Click 'load unpacked extension' and select the folder

If you'd like to use your own backend service:
5. Set up https://github.com/DatGuy1/ipa_server
6. Select the extension, press on options, and set the URL to the result of the previous step
